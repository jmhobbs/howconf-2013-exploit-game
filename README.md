# HowConf Software Exploitation Game

This code is the intentionally poorly written code used at HowConf 2013.

The code in /var/www should be run under Apache2, and the entry point is at /var/www/index.php

You proceed to exploit problems in each "level" to get the username/password you need to move on to the next level.

The final level is done in an SSH session, so you will need a "level5" and "level6" user on the machine, with the code from /home in their home directories.
