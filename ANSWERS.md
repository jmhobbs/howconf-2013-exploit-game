# SPOILER ALERT!

They all basically boil down to some form of user input sanitation.

# Level 1

Level one is an include flaw.  There is a page parameter which is not properly escaped, which allows access to the admin area through manipulation of the URL.

    index.php?page=admin/index.php

# Level 2

Level two is an unescaped SQL query, combined with over-exposed error information.

If you put some gibberish including a quote in the password field, you will get an error which contains the SQL query as run.

This should allow you to craft an SQL injection which will return a row and meet the conditions of the password check.

    ' OR '1' = '1

# Level 3

Level three is an insecure cookie.  Once you "log in" to level three, a cookie is set that marks you as logged in, but not as an admin.

Change "no" to "yes" and you are in.

# Level 4

Level four presents a gallery for uploading files.

![Level 4 - Isn't she cute?](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/28665584/screenshots/2013-09-14_16:36:44_471x421_daemeivedu.jpg)

The break here is that the upload isn't validated at all.  Upload some PHP, navigate to it and you can do anything you want as www-data.  If you look around, you will see a file called "Level-5-Password" which is what you need to move on.

# Level 5

Level five requires you to SSH in to the machine.  Where you are presented with an application which asks you a question, the answer to which is the password to level 6.  To check your answer, it compares the MD5 hash of your answer with an MD5 hash from a file.

Since the password is weak, and it's MD5, you can just Google the hash to find the word.

Google will gladly provide the answer, "t4co".

# Level 6

This is the final level.  To win the game you must yell out "Furry Watermelon Taco"
